# Stocklist-Analysis

# Overview

Awesome! Steve loved the new workbook I created for him. He was able to analyze the entire dataset. However, Steve wants to do a little more research for his parents and expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Though my code worked well for a dozen stocks, Steve suggested that with some refactorting it'll work as well for thousands of stocks. Refactoring is a vital part of coding. Nonetheless, I have been tasked to edit/refactor Module 2's solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information from said module. Following, I determine whether refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster. And lastly, I present a written analysis explaining my findings.

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
One of the most impactful benefits of refactoring code is that performance and run-time improves significantly. This allows for developers to use that newly available time to focus on organizing and streamlining code, making it easier to read. Another benefit of refactoring code is that less steps are involved. opportunity to improve/streamline the overall efficiency of the code. Often times, as coding languages are improved, and subsequent releases/patches are made, new logic and functions are available. Refactoring code allows for developers to bility to streamline new . Refactoring also affords developers a "fresh set of eyes" on code that may have been written in the past.  | A risk that comes with refactoring code is that changing large portions of code can introduce errors when it comes time to run. If the developer is not skilled enough, or did not save previous work, this can cause major issues. Another risk associated with refactoring code is the amount of time spent to refactor it.
