# Stocklist-Analysis

# Overview

Awesome! Steve loved the new workbook I created for him. He was able to analyze the entire dataset. However, Steve wants to do a little more research for his parents and expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Though my code worked well for a dozen stocks, Steve suggested that with some refactorting it'll work as well for thousands of stocks. Refactoring is a vital part of coding. Nonetheless, I have been tasked to edit/refactor Module 2's solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information from said module. Following, I determine whether refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster. And lastly, I present a written analysis explaining my findings.

# Summary
______________________________________________________________________________________
Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
One of the most impactful benefits of refactoring code is that performance and run-time improves significantly. This affords developers to make the code easier to read, as that newly available time is focused on organizing and streamlining code. Another benefit of refactoring code is that less steps are involved when running the altered code. Additionally, refactoring also grants developers the opportunity to improve upon old our outdated code.  | A risk that comes with refactoring code is that changing large portions of code can introduce errors when it comes time to run. If the developer is not skilled enough, or did not save previous work, this can cause major issues. Another risk associated with refactoring code is the amount of time spent to refactor it. Depending on the developers goal or vision, it may not be beneficial to refactor every single project; sometimes the rewards are poor in relation to the amount of time spent to refactor said code.
